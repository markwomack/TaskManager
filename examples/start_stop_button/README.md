# Start/Stop with Button Example

This sketch requires a little extra hardware in order to demonstrate
the Task Manager feature to monitor a pin for a change of state. The
pin is connected to a momentary button. When the button is pressed
the Task Manager starts or stops executing. Please see the image in
this directory for a picture of the circuit that will work with the
sketch.
