# Start/Stop with Button Example

This sketch requires a little extra hardware in order to demonstrate
the Task Manager feature to monitor a pin for a change of state, and
when a state change is detected the Task Manager starts or stops
executing. Please see the image in this directory for a picture of
the circuit that will work with the sketch.
